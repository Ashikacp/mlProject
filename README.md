## End to End Machine Learning Project


### Project Title: Student Exam Performance Prediction Web Application

### Description: 
Developed a Flask web application for predicting student exam performance using machine learning techniques. The project involved a comprehensive pipeline for data ingestion, transformation, and model training, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Key features included:
### Technologies Used: 
  - Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Docker, AWS (ECS, ECR), GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
### Data Ingestion: 
  -  Implemented a robust data ingestion module to load and preprocess student data from CSV files, ensuring data integrity and preparing datasets for analysis.
### Data Transformation: 
  -  Developed a preprocessing pipeline using ColumnTransformer to handle categorical and numerical features effectively, including missing value imputation and feature scaling.
### Model Training: 
  -  Evaluated multiple regression models (including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, and XGBoost) using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model selection based on performance metrics.
### Custom Prediction Pipeline:
  -  Created a prediction pipeline that encapsulates model loading and input feature transformation, enabling seamless integration with the web application for real-time predictions.
### Logging and Error Handling:
  -  Integrated logging and custom exception handling to improve maintainability and facilitate debugging.
